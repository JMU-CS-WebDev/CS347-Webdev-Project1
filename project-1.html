                <h1>Project 1</h1>
                <p>Project 1 is an idea for a new video game that derives inspiration from two different games specifically: Sekiro and Hyper Light Drifter.</p>
                <p>Sekiro is a video game that is known for its brutal difficulty curve, as it was made by the same studio that made the infamous Dark Souls series.  Ideally we are not drawing from that, and are instead drawing from the majesty that the game inspired in us.</p>
                <p>Sekiro has these beautiful moments in a game that's entire world is defined by struggle.  The world is rotting away, a warlord is killing everyone in the area, and even the environment hopes for your destruction.  Despite this suffocating atmosphere, the game has this natural beauty present that makes you stop and admire the world around you.  It feels surreal.  "It honestly was one of the original reasons I started playing video games.  I watched Ben launch that game on his computer and marveled at the beauty of the environment around him, even if I despised the gameplay and didn't understand the story," said Dhruv.</p>
                <p>Hyper Light Drifter on the other hand has a more stable difficulty curve.  The world and atmosphere are still very similar, but are portrayed in an entirely different style.  Hyper Light Drifter uses pixel graphics on a top-down viewport to display its game, and it does this to great effect.  The artwork is amazing.  The game flaunts this to you when you first load up a new save and have to watch the cutscene.  It almost feels like a crime to skip it, even if you've seen it 100 times.</p>
                <p>One thing that we would criticise about both of the games is the way that the story is told.  Sekiro's story, while enjoyable, is barebones.  It tells it to your face, but it doesn't mean a whole lot to me.  It doesn't feel like it wants me to care about the characters.  Hyper Light Drifter has no dialog what-so-ever and instead conveys all of its story through characters moving around on the screen or nodding or little portraits that give you clues.  The game would be easily one of the best games of all time if it had more cutscenes like the opening one.  Even if it didn't have dialog.</p>
                <p>Honestly both of these games have lead us to the conlusion that it would be better off to tell a story through well-animated cutscenes with a more central focus on how the story plays on its own.  If we can make an experience where the story is central and the gameplay supports that, but is also able to stand on its own, then we're certain that it will be magnificient.</p>
                <p>Thus, Project 1 was born.</p>
