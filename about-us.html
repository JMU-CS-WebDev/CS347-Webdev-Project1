                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>We are a group of three thinkers and dreamers who hope to change the way video games are experienced and movies are percieved.</p>
                <p>We all grew up to enjoy different things.  Dhruv is a writer, reader, and film critic.  Devin is a christian above all else, who loves deep introspective and weird movies alike.  Benjamin is a video-game critic, who enjoys coding, narrative film, and nature.</p>
                <p>When we met at JMU.  We delved deep into eachother's hobbies.  Benjamin introduced the others to less mainstream video games that were more like works of art and experiences than anything else.  Games like <a href="https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/outer-wilds.html" target="_blank">Outer Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.hollowknight.com/" target="_blank">Hollow Knight</a>.  Devin introduced Ben and Dhruv to a stranger side of cinema, populated by movies such as Horse Girl and Karthik Calling Karthik.  While Dhuv introduced Ben and Devin to older cult classics and newer heart throbs.  Movies such as a Silent Voice and Silence of the Lambs became known to the others.</p>
                <p>And as we began to dig deeper into eachother's hobbies, we began to have some criticisms of the current trajectories of the industry.</p>
                <p>"Video games have very basic stories, with very minimal humanity or experience put into them, so they feel like a waste of time," Dhruv told Benjamin.  "Why should I play a narrative video game if I have to collect 20 eggs in between every meaningful moment, or the story just sucks.  I'd rather read a book or watch any half-decent movie.  On top of that it often comes with an obscene $60 pricetag."</p>
                <p>These complaints gave us an idea.  We could make a joint film and video-game studio.  A studio that could create video games with meaningful stories and pricetags that do not break the bank.</p>
                <p>Devin always complained to Dhruv about how "even though movies may have a lot of meaining and human experience, it still not the same as walking outside and meeting someone new.  The human experience is almost always how someone feels when they're facing death or some other great tragedy."</p>
                <p>This complaint sparked an idea in Devin and Dhruv's heads to make short biographical films inverviewing various denizens of harrisonburg, and will likely be the first step in their directing experience.</p>
