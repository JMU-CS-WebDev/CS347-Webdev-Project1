                <h1>Report</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>You will create a website with a focused theme and audience of your choosing. Your site might serve a student group, a relative who’s planning a wedding, a business, or an artist who needs a portfolio. The site must serve someone besides yourself. A large part of web design is thinking empathetically, and this requirement makes that explicit.<br><br>A very interesting requirement.  I fulfilled this to my belief that this company is namely my roommate's idea.  Of course you could maybe say that this is also for myself as I would be a part of said company.  However, I modeled this after what I thought they would like, not what I like.</li>
                    <li>Your content must be original and not lifted from other websites. Third-party images are acceptable provided you adhere to their license.<br><br>I coded all of my CSS out of my own brain.  The only sources I used were the textbook and other educational websites.  The third party images I used do not require me to do anything to use them for as long as I keep the Icons8 membership provided to me via the Github Student Developer pack.</li>
                    <li>Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files should be named index.html, which Apache loads by default.<br><br>My website contains five separate pages.  One is named index.html.</li>
                    <li>Your site must include some sort of header.<br><br>The website has this lovely logo and company name header at the top of every page.</li>
                    <li>Your site must include some sort of navigation links.<br><br>I have a usable navbar at the top of every page of the website.  The navbar even follows you as you scroll!</li>
                    <li>Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. For instance, multicolumn layouts on large screens should be reduced to single column layouts on small screens.<br><br>My website adjusts size once you get to less than 1000px on the viewport.  It looks quite lovely on phones in my opinion.</li>
                    <li>Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Repeated style rules must be placed in a shared external stylesheet. Style rules not shared between pages must be placed in separate external stylesheets.<br><br>My website has no internal stylesheets.  All my style is located on my boilerplate.css stylesheet.</li>
                    <li>Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Repeated style rules must be placed in a shared external stylesheet. Style rules not shared between pages must be placed in separate external stylesheets.<br><br>My website has images, and every one has an alt tag describing what they do.</li>
                    <li>Each page must declare its favicon.<br><br>My website has a favicon on every page you visit.</li>
                    <li>Your site’s non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be placed in a directory named images. CSS files must be placed in a directory named css. If you include any JavaScript code, these files must be placed in a directory named js.<br><br>All of my images are located in the images subfolder, and all of my css is in the css subfolder.</li>
                    <li>Your site must not be built using any libraries or frameworks. Do not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, or any other third-party tools. You may, however, reimplement the ideas you see in these third-party tools.<br><br>It isn't.</li>
                    <li>Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the W3C’s Nu Validator.<br><br>It does.  I have pasted the address to every page into the Nu Validator with no errors.</li>
                    <li>The content should be neatly aligned. The axes of alignment should be clearly visible. Favor left- and right-alignment over centering—as centering does not produce a strong axis of alignment.<br><br>There is a strong axis of alignment.  You can look at the website and see how everything is left justified or right justified.  The only exemption may be the footer.</li>
                    <li>The content should have adequate and consistent spacing. Text should never bleed against the edge of its containing box.<br><br>It doesn't.  There is a suitable margin/padding on every attribute.</li>
                    <li>Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and paragraph copy in a serif font.<br><br>I used 2 different fonts that I found off of google fonts.  EB Garamond and Cabin.  They both do the trick I believe.</li>
                    <li>Your site must include at least one form. The form need not do anything at this point in your learning, but it must be present. Like all content, it must be neatly aligned.<br><br>The form element is present, and it looks good on mobile too.  It is also neatly aligned with the other text.</li>
                    <li>Your site must include links to external sites.<br><br>This one was kind of a box to be checked, but I put links on the names of Outer Wilds and Hollow Knight on the About Us page.</li>
                    <li>Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for classes and IDs. Favor kebab-case case identifiers over camelCase.<br><br>I used kebab-case identifiers the entire time.  I used conventional formatting with the "flexbox holy grail" as described in the textbook.</li>
                    <li>Your site must include at least one animation, powered either by CSS or JavaScript.<br><br>The buttons on the website are animated to change color.  The navlinks are too, but its much faster, as I did it to make it feel less astonishing when you hover over them.</li>
                    <li>Your site must be stored in a Git repository that you have shared with your instructor. On GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, share with the user hcientist.<br><br>I have done this on GitHub.  He hasn't accepted the request yet.</li>
                    <li>The names of your files must be entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.<br><br>The names of my files are lowercase and only contain alphanumeric characters, save a couple dashes.  I could easily fix this but it seemed contradictory to ditch dashes when we are supposed to be favoring kebab-case.</li>
                    <li>Both https://project1.YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME and http://project1.YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME should resolve to your project 1 site, the latter being redirected to the former as follows.<br><br>Yes and Yes.</li>
                    <li>Your site must be served out over HTTPS on port 443. You are encouraged to use Let’s Encrypt (Links to an external site.) to obtain a free certificate.<br><br>Yes.</li>
                    <li>Users who access your site over HTTP on port 80 must be automatically redirected to port 443.<br><br>Yes.</li>
                    <li>Your Git repository should show a steady flow of commits over the course of the project. Committing and pushing should happen steadily, after each work session, and not just right before the due date.<br><br>The fabled "catch out the slacker" requirement.  As much as I hate to say this, I fail this requirement.  Unfortunately for me, I have had five concurrent projects and 3 exams over the last 2 weeks.  I am not going to work on a little bit of each project every day, as it is extremely ineffecient.  I will take the grade hit on this one I guess if it needs to be dealt.  Feels pretty lame.</li>
                    <li>In https://project1.YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME/report.html, write a brief report containing an itemized breakdown of how you believe you have met the expectations listed above.<br><br>Here it is!</li>
