                    <li>You will create a website with a focused theme and audience of your choosing. Your site might serve a student group, a relative whoâ€™s planning a wedding, a business, or an artist who needs a portfolio. The site must serve someone besides yourself. A large part of web design is thinking empathetically, and this requirement makes that explicit.<br><br>A very interesting requirement.  I fulfilled this to my belief that this company is namely my roommate's idea.  Of course you could maybe say that this is also for myself as I would be a part of said company.  However, I modeled this after what I thought they would like, not what I like.</li>
                    <li>Your content must be original and not lifted from other websites. Third-party images are acceptable provided you adhere to their license.<br><br>I coded all of my CSS out of my own brain.  The only sources I used were the textbook and other educational websites.  The third party images I used do not require me to do anything to use them for as long as I keep the Icons8 membership provided to me via the Github Student Developer pack.</li>
                    <li>Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files should be named index.html, which Apache loads by default.<br><br>My website contains five separate pages.  One is named index.html.</li>
                    <li>Your site must include some sort of header.<br><br>The website has this lovely logo and company name header at the top of every page.</li>
                    <li>Your site must include some sort of navigation links.<br><br>I have a usable navbar at the top of every page of the website.  The navbar even follows you as you scroll!</li>
                    <li>Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. For instance, multicolumn layouts on large screens should be reduced to single column layouts on small screens.<br><br>My website adjusts size once you get to less than 1000px on the viewport.  It looks quite lovely on phones in my opinion.</li>
